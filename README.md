A strength and weakness of Node is that it imposes no structure on your application.  While this gives those very familiar with it a lot of freedom, it does give the newcomer a little difficulty when knowing how to get started.  Express helped us a lot, but we're still having to come up with where to put files.

This episode presents a solution, proposing an app structure that has successfully taken some apps from inception to production.  We don't build a framework, per se; we just show a way of organizing our app so that everything has a place, and we know where to find what we're looking for.

As a bonus, we get to see a judicious use of a global variable and how we define them.  We also make the app more meta in that it becomes aware of itself.
